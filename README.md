# 🔐📎 InvStat
InvStat is strong server invites monitoring bot that allows you to<br>
・📨 know inviter of participant<br>
・🔢 counts people invited by a particular user<br>
・🚫 kick users who invited by specified troll user<br>
**It protects your server from malicious users and manage private server invitations for security!** 🔐 


# To Get Started!<br>
#### 📈  Enable monitoring:
At first use `i/enable` to enable monitor invites and report logs!<br>
After that, logs will automaticully sended to log channel!<br>
The setting is over. <u>How easy to setup!</u><br>

#### 🚫 **If you unfortunately face a troll user:**
`i/kick @user` to kick specified user and delete all invites that made by specified user. (You can ban them by `i/ban @user` too)

#### 📎 If they use same invite url to join to the server:
`i/kick_together @user` to kick all users who invited by specified user. (You can ban them by `i/ban_together @user` too)


## ⚠ ATTENTION
Discord doesn't provide inviter information directly,<br>
so I can't get information about the users who joined before monitoring was enabled with the `i/enable` command.<br> 
We recommend you to invite this BOT earlier when you make the server!<br>
**But don't worry, you are not late! please add bot to start monitoring!** 😉
